                            <h2>Project Description:</h2>
                            <p>PopcornPeek is a dynamic web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that caters to the entertainment needs of users by allowing them to explore trending movies, TV shows, and anime. PopcornPeek is more than just a listing of entertainment content. It offers a deeper dive into each show, movie, or anime. Users can view trailers, read comprehensive descriptions, explore similar content, and access useful information such as age ratings, IMDb ratings, status, and more.</p>
                            <p>One of the major challenges faced during the development of this project was handling API usage limitations. As movie information changes frequently, it was essential to provide users with the most recent data while dealing with the API's constraints. One solution was to leverage the power of IndexedDB, a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data. A system was implemented to save the received data from the API to IndexedDB. This data is refreshed once a day, ensuring the website provides users with current information without exceeding the API's call limit. This strategy not only maintains data freshness but also improves the application's performance, as a lot of the data can be served directly from the local IndexedDB storage, resulting in quicker load times and a smoother user experience.</p>
