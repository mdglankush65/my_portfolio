                    <p className="section-description">I'm a determined person that appreciates technology and programming. After researching numerous employment opportunities in college and concluding that the traditional educational path was not for me, I opted to pursue my love of software development. I have a strong interest in programming and have graduated from the University of Guru Ghasidas in Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. My ambition is to use my newly learned skills to assist businesses and organizations in developing innovative solutions to difficult problems. I am a quick learner who thrives in a fast-paced environment. I can't wait to have a positive influence in the tech sector and am eager to see where this path takes me.</p>
